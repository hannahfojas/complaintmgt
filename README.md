**About the System**

The Complaint Management system lets user register, track, and close customer complaints end-to-end. Its purpose is to make intake consistent and fast, keep each complaint’s details, and give teams clear visibility into what’s open vs. completed.

Users can create complaints via a validated form, view the latest complaints in a list, edit details as information changes, and update status through Open > In Progress > Resolved or Closed – No Resolution. A simple status filter helps focus the list, complaint age is calculated to highlight how long items have been active, and resolution notes can be captured when closing or resolving to document outcomes.
